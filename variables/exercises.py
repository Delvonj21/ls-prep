# What happens when you run the following code? Why?

# NAME = 'Victor'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

# NAME = 'Nina'
# print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
# print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)
# The Code greets Victor three times and then greets Nina three times


#8 Challenge: This program uses a bit of math. Don't let that scare you away -- try it anyway.

# Assume you have $1,000.00 in the bank, and you've somehow managed to find a bank that pays you 5% (this is a wish-fulfillment fantasy) compounded interest every year. After one year, you will have $1,050 ($1,000 times 1.05). After two years, you will have $1,050 times 1.05, or $1102.50. Create a variable named balance that contains the amount of money you will have after 5 years, then print the result. Use a single expression if you can to set balance to the correct value.

# balance = (1000.00 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05)
# print(balance)

# Repeat the previous question but, this time, use augmented assignment to compute the final result, one year at a time.

balance = 1000.00
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
print(balance)

# Assume that obj already has a value of 42 when the code below starts running. Which of the subsequent statements reassign the variable? Which statements mutate the value of the object that obj references? Which statements do neither? If necessary, you can read the documentation.

# obj = 'ABcd'          reassignment
# obj.upper()           neither
# obj = obj.lower()     reassignment
# print(len(obj))       neither
# obj = list(obj)       reassignment
# obj.pop()             mutation
# obj[2] = 'X'          mutation
# obj.sort()            mutation
# set(obj)              neither
# obj = tuple(obj)      reassignment
