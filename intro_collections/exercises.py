#1 If you have a list named people, how can you determine the number of entries in that list?
# len(people)

#2 Can you write some code to change the value 'bye' in the following tuple to 'goodbye'?
# stuff = ('hello', 'world', 'bye', 'now')

# new_tup = ('hello', 'world', 'goodbye', 'now')

#3 Assuming you have the following assignment:
# pi = 3.141592
# Write some code that converts the value of pi to a string and assigns it to a variable named str_pi.

# str_pi = str(pi)

#4 Without running the following code, identify the numbers that are included in each of the following ranges:
# range(7)            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]         
# range(1, 6)         [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# range(3, 15, 4)     [3, 7, 11]
# range(3, 8, -1)     []
# range(8, 3, -1)     [8, 7, 6, 5, 4]

#5 How would you print all the numbers in the following range?

# range(3, 17, 4)

# print(list(range(3, 17, 4)))

#6 Consider the data in the following table:

# Name	Country
# Alice	USA
# Francois	Canada
# Inti	Peru
# Monika	Germany
# Sanyu	Uganda
# Yoshitaka	Japan

# countries = {
#     'Alice' :    'USA',
#     'Francois':  'Canada',
#     'Inti':      'Peru',
#     'Monika':    'Germany',
#     'Sanyu':     'Uganda',
#     'Yoshitaka': 'Japan'
# }

# print('countries'['Alica'])
